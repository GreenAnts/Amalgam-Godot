# Amalgam

A two player (competitive) abstract strategy game that requires you to tactically utilize your pieces  in conjunction with one another to either eliminate the opponents pieces or carefully get a valuable piece to the other side of the board.

| [Join Our Discord](https://discord.gg/gKHjJNBWAd) | We hope to build a playtesting community to refine our game. Due to the very technical nature of the game, we believe we need as much playtesting as we can get in order to create balanced rules thatare also enjoyable to play. Additionally, the community will hopefully act as a way to find other players and share strategies. |
| [Rules Document](https://imgur.com/a/amalgam-board-game-rules-0lTmlgR) | As we iterate on the game and make changes to the rules, the newest version of the rules document can be found here.|
| [Website](https://www.amalgamboardgame.com/) | This is basically another way to read the rules, that are possibly more accessible. |
| [Tabletop Simulator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1402132394&searchtext=amalgam)  | Although this is something we need to update, this will act as a 3d alternative to SCREENTOP.GG|
| [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/qRPrGfseCU4) | Reading the rules not your thing? Or maybe you read the rules but you are still confused...Try watching the video walk through to get a better understanding. |
| [A short story of our journey so far](https://www.patreon.com/posts/amalgam-board-113134314?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=join_link) |  Before starting back up on this project again, I wrote up a short article about our LONG journey of trying to make this game a reality. It's been about 10 years since I first designed the initial idea of this project, and hopefully it will soon finally become a reality!|
