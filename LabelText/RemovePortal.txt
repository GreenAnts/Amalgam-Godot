PORTALS also remove the opponent's pieces from play when they "TOUCH" the opponent's piece. By moving to the GREEN circle your PORTAL is "TOUCHING" the opponent's PORTAL, and will therefore remove it from play. Although "TOUCHING" for portals seems much farther, it is in reality the same principle as it is for other pieces. Just be careful as the distance can often be deceiving!
